## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1

  The first lab that we ever did was one of my favorites as it was the introduction and getting to understand the first basic concepts of coding. In this lab we learned how to create a folder, clone a repository, and edit code. Overall, this has to be one of my favorites as this is what helped us get started and get better.

* Lab 4, part 2

   This lab was my second favorite lab as it introduced me to using if statements in the code that had to be edited. This lab was about a game called Hi-Lo, and consisted of one player choosing a number and the other player having to guess it and if they guess it right then they win, but if they guess it wrong the first player gets to give them a hint if it’s higher or lower. It’s a pretty small game but it was fun implementing if statements into the code.

* Lab 8, part 1

   This was another of my favorite labs as it wasn’t too complicated and was actually fun as it was about putting a sandwich together. In this part of the lab we had to get a string of arguments and make it so that it executes into one final thing, which was the sandwich. For the sandwich we had to edit the code to where we pick a protein, type of bread, and a condiment, and I will say it was probably one of the most fun labs we did.
